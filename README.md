## **Pharmacokinetic modelling**

[Link to project description](https://sabs-r3.github.io/software-engineering-projects/01-introduction/index.html)

*This repository contains a Python library that can specify, solve and visualise the solution of a PK model.*

### **Features**

1. The user can specify the form of the PK model. This includes the number of peripheral compartments, the type of dosing (intravenous bolus versus subcutaneous), and the dosing protocol.
2. The user can specify the protocol independently from the model (e.g. be able to solve a one and two compartment model for the same dosing protocol)
3. The user can solve for the drug quantity in each compartment over time, given a model and a protocol
4. Visualisation of the solution of a model. The user can compare two different solutions.

### **User instructions**

 - instructions for how to use software needed
 - example code
